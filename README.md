# Wedding Wishes App
A React Native application to collect and seek inspiration for wedding guestbook messages.

## Purpose of this project
This is a personal project born from the desire to practice coding and an attempt to resolve an issue that has occurred several times during the past few years - writer's block when faced with a wedding guestbook. Use by a wider audience was not the original intention.

## How does it work?
#### Items may be added to three collections:
- Topics
- Quotes
- Descriptions of Wine

#### When inspiration is required:
1. Select the desired prompt category from the tab navigation bar.
2. Random item from the associated collection will be displayed.
3. If the displayed is not appropriate for the circumstance, click "Try Again" for another item of the same category or select a different category from the tab navigation bar.

## Included files
This repository contains:
- React Native files for user interface
- C# files for the web service
  including the following types of XML files:
  - Schemas
  - Templates
  - Test data

The above are sufficient to recreate the application by using a blank Managed Workflow expo template for the UI and the Microsoft Visual Studio ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) project template.

## Credits
Tab navigation icons are sourced from [Ionic](https://ionic.io) via the [expo-vector-icons package](https://github.com/expo/vector-icons)
